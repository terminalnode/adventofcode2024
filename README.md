# Advent of Code 2024 ![gofmt](https://github.com/terminalnode/adventofcode2024/workflows/gofmt/badge.svg)
This year's advent of code is being solved in Go as a series of webservices.
Each webservice exposes `POST /1` and `POST /2` which accepts an `text/plain`
with the puzzle input as data.

The services can be easily run with `docker-compose up` from the root directory.
The URL for a given solution is `http://localhost:${3000+day}/${part}` For example
if you have your puzzle input in a file called `input` and want to get the solution for
day 1 part 2, you would run `curl -X POST --data-binary @input http://localhost:3001/2`.

## Using the client
The client is a simple utility for running against the services in `docker-compose`.
`client.sh` is a simple wrapper for `go run ./client`. Run it with `-h` for more 
information.

## Progress
* ‚≠ê means solved
* ü•∏ means solved, but not a very satisfying solution
* üí© means solved, but...
